The viewers are calculated wrong, you store multiple entries for the same customers, causing havoc when calculating the view count.
If one customer swapped to TV2, and later swapped to TV Norge, TV2 would always add a -1 view, later a new
event could be registered for the same customer where he switches back to TV2, from TV Norge, now it will add a +1 again,
BUT the view count will be 0, for both channels. It should be 0 for TV Norge only... And 1 for TV2.
